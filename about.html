                <h3>What is the difference between Synergy 1 and 2?</h3>
                <p>What makes Synergy 2 better than Synergy 1 is that Synergy 2 is a smaller and more compact model of Synergy 1. The main goal with using Synergy 2 was to have a smaller, lighter, and more portable computer charging station compared to Synergy 1, allowing it to get to places faster than Synergy 1.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between Synergy 2 and 3?</h3>
                <p>	Synergy 3 will be better than Synergy 2 in many ways. One goal is for Synergy 3 to be mostly capable of being 3d printable, and being even more light, compact, and portable than Synergy 2 by using only the components of a car battery instead of the full thing. Another goal is for it to have more outlets so it can charge even more things.</p>
