                <p>We created this website because we wanted to share the designs with the public. Due to wanting to share these designs we made this website in order to share these designs with the public so they can see them.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between Synergy 1 and 2?</h3>
                <p>What makes Synergy 2 better than Synergy 1 is that Synergy 2 is a smaller and more compact model of Synergy 1. The main goal with using Synergy 2 was to have a smaller, lighter, and more portable computer charging station compared to Synergy 1, allowing it to get to places faster than Synergy 1.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between Synergy 2 and 3?</h3>
                <p>	Synergy 3 will be better than Synergy 2 in many ways. One goal is for Synergy 3 to be mostly capable of being 3d printable, and being even more light, compact, and portable than Synergy 2 by using only the components of a car battery instead of the full thing. Another goal is for it to have more outlets so it can charge even more things.</p>
