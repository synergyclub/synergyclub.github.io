                <h3>Why did you chose this project?</h3>
                <p> The solar panel-powered charging station for the Chromebooks project was chosen because of its sustainability focus and potential to reduce energy costs. By harnessing renewable energy, this initiative promotes environmental responsibility, supports educational access in remote areas, and aligns with eco-friendly initiatives, making a positive impact on communities and future generations.</p>

                <h3>Where is Synergy located?</h3>
                <p>The Synergy Team, based at Strath Haven School in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, meets every Friday afternoon under the guidance of Mr. Ward. Our sessions, extending until 4:30-5:00 PM, allow us to collaborate and delve into engineering, design, and other vital components of our club, fostering teamwork and innovation.</p>

                <h3>Eco-friendliness</h3>
                <p>The thing that sets Synergy apart from other technologies is that both Synergy 1 and 2 are completely eco-friendly due to being solar powered. This means that they are much better for the environment than the average charger will be as it uses less fossil fuels.</p>
